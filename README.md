<!-- # My Timer Project

## What is this project?

This is a simple timer project I made using the Qt framework. And since this is a Python project, I used PyQt5.

---

## Why did I create this?

It was mostly just me practicing using Qt and it sort of turned into a project I wanted to make.  
I also wanted to try and get something onto Github. Even if the projects I have are not the best, it's still something I have to let others see in order learn more and have fun.
And one might talk about this little README that I have made but, please know that this is my first time and that I'm completely susceptible to errors here. XD

## How does it work?

You must set the time by setting the hours, minutes, and seconds in the layout that is above the timer.  
You will see a plus and minus button for each time unit in the layout. 
You can also click on the numbers inbetween the plus and minus buttons for each unit in order to pick a number of your choosing.  
However, you are required to do the following:  
1. You must enter a number(Of course).
2. For hours, you must choose a number ranging from 0 and 99.
3. For minutes and seconds, you must choose a number ranging from 0 and 59.

Afterwards all that is left is to press the set button to apply the time you have set to the timer below.  
Here are the other buttons:  

### Start  

---
Pressing the start button has the timer start counting down. The timer will stop counting down when it reaches zero, when you hit the pause button, or when you reset the clock.

---

### Pause/Resume

---
Next is the Pause and resume buttons. These two are together because they share one button(When you press the pause or resume button the button you pressed will change into the other button you didn't press. Example: Pause changes into resume when you press the pause button).

The pause button basically stops the timer count down until you hit resume which resumes the count down.

These buttons cannot be used if you have yet to start the timer.

---

### Reset

---

We now move on to the reset button, this sets the timer to the time you have last set it, or to the default time if you didn't set the timer(Which is 0).  

You can only use this button if you have already started the timer(Pressing the start button)

---

### +30 sec and -30 sec buttons

---

These two buttons change the amount of time on the timer during count down.  
1. The "+30 seconds" button gives the timer a 30 second increase.
2. The "-30 seconds" button gives the timer a 30 second decrease.

I might try changing the 30 seconds into any amount of time you want in the future.

## What do you need to use it?

## Conclusion
You Reeeeally don't have to use this for daily. I'm mostly doing this to showcase my skills. Again, all of this may seem sloppy, but this is my starting point, so I'll have no choice but to show it. -->

## What is it:
This is a simple timer project. You can set, extend, shorten, and restart the timer.

## What did I use:
I used Python code for the logic and PyQt5 for the interface.

## Requirements to use:
PyQt5 must be installed in order to use this program.
